# toolbox-tracking
The toolbox tracking was developed to ease the tracking of bumblebees in difficult conditions (low lighting, changing lighting, complex background). It is based on opencv (A mastodonte toolbox for computer vision) and mostly wrap opencv functions to fit the need of tracking the position and long body axis of a flying bumblebee. It has no support, has no scope to gain popularities, and may be replaced by anything better whenever found a suitable replacement...
